      "description": [
        "Machine learning has revolutionized the field of drug discovery by enabling the rapid identification of novel therapeutic compounds. In this project, we developed a deep learning model to predict the binding affinity of small molecules to target proteins, with the goal of accelerating the drug discovery process. Our model achieved state-of-the-art performance on a benchmark dataset and demonstrated the potential to significantly reduce the time and cost associated with drug development.",
        "Drug discovery is a complex and time-consuming process that involves the identification of lead compounds, optimization of their chemical properties, and evaluation of their biological activity. Traditional methods for predicting drug-target interactions are often limited by their reliance on experimental data and lack of scalability. Machine learning offers a promising alternative by leveraging large-scale datasets to learn complex patterns and make accurate predictions."
